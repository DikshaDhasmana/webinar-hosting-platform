# Login Flow Fix Tasks

## Issues Identified
- Race condition in main login page: checks user role immediately after login
- Missing authLoading state handling in main login page
- Inconsistent login flow patterns across pages

## Tasks
- [x] Fix race condition in frontend/src/app/login/page.tsx by adding useEffect to watch user changes
- [x] Add authLoading check to main login page for consistency
- [x] Ensure all login pages follow the same pattern for role checking and redirects
- [x] Test the login flow after fixes (dev server already running)
